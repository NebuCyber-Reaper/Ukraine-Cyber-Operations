| 8 July | Google TAG | The Turla APT group created a fake Android app (APK) designed to look like a DDoS hacktivist tool developed by the Ukrainian Azov Regiment. The APKs we have seen were hosted on a Turla controlled domain with links disseminated through 3rd party messaging services. They were not hosted on the Play Store. | [twitter.com/billyleonard](https://twitter.com/billyleonard/status/1545461166377508865) |
